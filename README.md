Jean Lannes died in 1809 after the Battle of Aspern-Essling. He witnessed his friend get decapitated by a cannonball, and after sitting down to mourn his loss, was hit by a cannonball himself. 

This simulator sets the player as Jean Lannes, and the main goal is to dodge cannonballs. All sprites are drawn by me.




thanks a TON to LazyFoo.net for their tutorials on SDL as well as MakeFiles, without them I probably would have used PyGame LOL
